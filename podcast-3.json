Thank you, Bill. Here's what's happening this week in America. GOP debate coming up. Questions for Maui. 30-year interest rates highest in 21 years. And SoCal braces for a potential hurricane. It's all coming up. Then Bill will be here with your message of the day. But first, the first GOP primary debate coming up this Wednesday night. In order to get on the stage, you need one percent and a couple of different polls, one percent support. You need 40,000 donors and you have to sign a pledge committing to support the ultimate GOP nominee. Trump has not done that last thing. The debate goers right now are Ron DeSantis, Tim Scott, Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, Chris Christie, Doug Burgum and Mike Pence. There's been a rumor that if Trump does not go to the debate, we'll offer some counterprogramming instead. Trump also has to show up in Georgia to be arraigned any time before Friday. More questions about the sirens in Maui that were never used. The state has 400 emergency sirens across the state. It's the largest integrated emergency siren network in the world. And it alerts residents to tsunamis and wildfires. There's 80 of these sirens in Maui and in the area around Lahaina. They were not used on August 8th. Authorities say these sirens were not used because they were broken. Some say they weren't activated and some were worried that it would send people into higher ground, thinking people think it was a tsunami and they'd go higher ground, but that's where the fires actually were. There was a thought to use the mobile phone alert, but if you remember back in 2018, residents of Hawaii got an alert on their phone. Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. So they don't have a great record with that. 30 year fixed rates went up to 7.09 percent, the highest they've been in 21 years. When the Fed started raising rates, the 30 year average was 4.45 percent. In 1995, the interest rates were 7.8 percent, a bit higher than they are now. But the average house was one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Today, the average house is four hundred twenty thousand dollars. That's a difference in payment of seven hundred dollars to two thousand dollars. Back in 1995, your house was about 31 percent of your income today with average income and average house. It's 49 percent of one's income. Southern California on high alert Hurricane Hillary, category two on Thursday, it's going to hit the coast of Mexico, work its way up to Southern California. San Diego, the southernmost city in California, has only had one hurricane in recent memory. Back in 1858, Mike Slater for the podcast Politics by Faith. Hope you have a wonderful weekend. The great Bill O'Reilly is here with your message of the day. I'm so sorry, ma'am. I know you need this medicine, but it looks like it's not covered by your insurance. Yeah, unfortunately, I had to deny that one. Wait, who are you? I'm your insurance company's pharmacy benefit manager.

Paid for by Pharma. Time now for the O'Reilly Update message of the day. Since less than 20 percent of American adults now consume corporate media, the perception of Donald Trump has evolved into a street corner issue. By that, I mean that folks are forming opinions about Trump's legal problems by what they are told by friends and family rather than what the say anything for profit news organizations put out. This is not a positive development because false information streaks through casual conversations and everybody knows that. And there is no longer a fair press to correct the record. So, most Americans live in a daze of misinformation and ideological propaganda. That is the truth. More truth. Donald Trump was far too casual with the rules and that is causing him and the Republican Party tremendous grief. I mean, come on, just send the blanken documents back to the National Archives, right? Who gives a fig? Same thing with the election stuff. State your opinion and then do everything you can legally to write what you think was wrong. I said a few days after the 2020 vote that Attorney General Barr should have appointed a special prosecutor to look into fraud allegations. That Rudy Giuliani wasn't close to being enough. But as always, Donald Trump marches to that different drummer. And here we are. I'm Bill O'Reilly. I approve the message by writing it. You can reach me, bill at billoerily.com, bill at billoerily.com, name and town if you wish to opine. Okay, let's go to the mail. Michael Long, uh, leave some at Missouri. How did your grand juries get chosen? How does it work? Okay, regular folks get a summons. 23 people in whatever area, whatever county on the ground. Jury takes 12 to indict. That's how it goes. Getting a little mail, you got to show up, do your duty. Steve Webb, St. George, Utah. In the documents trial with Donald Trump, will he be able to subpoena Bill Clinton, George Bush and Barack Obama to discuss their classified documents? Yeah, they won't come into the courtroom, but the judge should allow a deposition to the three men. Absolutely. Mike Johnson, Atlanta. I'm worried that Michelle Obama's going to run. I agree with you regarding she would be a shoe in. If she does, she would absolutely crush Trump. Right now, looks that way. Joyce Smith, Burnett, Texas. She said yesterday Michelle Obama would win the election if she ends up the nominee for the Democrats. What are your facts behind that opinion? Polling? Ahead of everybody. The people who buy Michelle Obama's book, a lot of them aren't reading it. They're just buying it because it helps her. Thomas Concierge, remember, and we urge everybody to check out the Concierge membership. Thomas says, Bill, you always say there was no election fraud. Right away, Thomas, you are misreporting what I said. I clearly stated on a number of occasions there was fraud. What there isn't is evidence that it would have turned the election in Trump's favor. Okay. Do I honestly believe Joe Biden received 80 million votes? I don't know. But if he didn't, I was ready to look at all the information that came in and nothing has risen. Every journalist will tell you that. In a moment, something you might not know. Now the O'Reilly Update brings you something you might not know. 87 years ago, 20,000 Americans gathered in Kentucky to see a convicted murderer hanged in the town square. It would be the last public execution in U.S. history. Here is the story. The practice of hanging criminals dates back to ancient Greece. It was considered a more humane method of execution than stoning or beheading. In the 16th century, hanging became the maximum punishment in England. The procedure was then exported to the British colonies in the New World. As I write in my upcoming book, Killing the Witches, 19 human beings were hanged in Salem for the crime of witchcraft. In the summer of 1936, a man named Rainey Bethea confessed to the rape and murder of a 70-year-old woman. The case became a national scandal. Rainey was black, the victim white, the local sheriff a woman. After a speedy trial, it took the jury just four minutes to return with a verdict, and the sentence was death by hanging. On August 14, Rainey was given his final meal, fried chicken, pork chops, mashed potatoes, cucumbers, cornbread, lemon pie, and ice cream. He was then walked into the town square and hanged before thousands of cheering spectators. Despite some condemnation from the public, it was a new technology that brought executions indoors, electricity. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, prisons replaced the noose with electric chairs. The chair was the default method of capital punishment in America until the states began using gas and lethal injections. And here's something else you might not know. Just one state in the Union still allows prisoners on death row to choose hanging as their ultimate punishment. That state is New Hampshire. While criminals can opt to hang from the neck until dead in the Granite State, it is still carried out in private, as it should be. Executions are not spectator sports. Back after this. That is the weekend edition of the O'Reilly Update. No spin, just facts. We are always looking out for you."}, "podcast_summary": "Summary:\n\nIn this transcript, a conversation between a customer and an insurance company's pharmacy benefit manager takes place.

He anchored the tabloid television program Inside Edition from 1989 to 1995. O'Reilly joined the Fox News Channel in 1996 and hosted The O'Reilly Factor until 2017. The O'Reilly Factor had been the highest-rated cable news show for 16 years, and he was described by media analyst Howard Kurtz as \"the biggest star in the 20-year history at Fox News\" at the time of his ousting.  He is the author of numerous books and hosted The Radio Factor (2002\u20132009).In early 2017, The New York Times reported that he and Fox News had paid five women approximately $13 million to settle various sexual misconduct lawsuits, which led to the network terminating O'Reilly's employment. An additional New York Times report (that O'Reilly paid legal analyst Lis Wiehl $32 million for allegedly initiating a \"non-consensual sexual relationship\" with her) led to him being dropped by the United Talent Agency and literary agency WME.
