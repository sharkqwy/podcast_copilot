I'm Dr. Mike, host of Going There. It was the first song where I wrote about how I felt like my depression was killing me and I didn't want it. Going There breaks the stigma of mental health issues by having real honest conversations with your favorite musicians including Alessia Cara, Lizzy Hale, Jewel, Jason Isbell, Gerard Way, Lauren Gray, Shamir, and Bartee Strange. There was something there that was so raw where I was like, wow, I can't believe someone would say that. Let's go there on Going There with Dr. Mike, brought to you by SoundMine Live and the Consequence Podcast Network every other Tuesday wherever you get your podcasts. Hello and welcome to the Spark Parade where I geek out with artists and entertainers about their cultural spark of inspiration. I'm Adam Onze at Spark Parade on Go There. Thanks ever so much for joining me. So, welcome to Film Fridays. This is an occasional series where, as the name suggests, I'll talk to filmmakers about their cultural spark of inspiration. Doesn't that sound fun? And today, I'm talking to director and producer Bill Polad about his Spark Radiohead's career-defining masterpiece, OK Computer. Amazing, right? And it's kind of an inspiration inception or something because Bill listened to OK Computer and he was like, I'm going to make a video about it. And it's kind of an inspiration inception or something because Bill listened to OK Computer while he edited his new movie, Dreamin' Wild, which is about Donnie and Joe Emerson, who in turn have inspired countless musicians and have been covered by artists like Hype Williams and Ariel Pink. Isn't that fucking cool? I think it is. And let's be clear, my opinion is the only one that matters. So, let's stop dilly-dallying and get right into it. Quick Bill Facts. Bill Polad is a film director and producer. As founder and CEO of River Road Entertainment, Polad has spent most of the last 20 years producing critically acclaimed films. His credits include Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Terrence Malick's Palme d'Or winning The Tree of Life, and Ang Lee's Academy Award winning epic, Brokeback Mountain. He directed, wrote, and produced his new film, Dreamin' Wild, which stars Casey Affleck, Noah Jupe, Walton Goggins, Zooey Deschanel, and Bo Bridges. It tells the extraordinary true story of brothers Donnie and Joe Emerson, who in the 1970s leveraged their family farm to produce their record, Dreamin' Wild, only to have it languish in obscurity. 30 years later, when the album was rediscovered, the brothers had an unexpected second chance at their musical careers. Dreamin' Wild was released on August 4th, and you should see it. Quick OK Computer Facts. OK Computer is the third studio album by English rock band Radiohead. On OK Computer, Radiohead distanced themselves from the guitar-centric, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound, and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work. Despite lowered sales estimates by EMI, who deemed the record uncommercial and difficult to market, OK Computer reached number one on the UK album chart and debuted at number 21 on the Billboard 200, Radiohead's highest album entry in the US charts at that time. The album was soon certified five times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. It expanded Radiohead's international popularity and has sold at least 7.8 million units worldwide to date. And there you have it. Let's get to the good stuff. Here comes my chat with Bill Polad about OK Computer. Do you remember hearing OK Computer for the first time, being turned on to it, anything like that? Yeah, so I was living in Dublin, Ireland at the time and editing a documentary film there. OK Computer came out and I was listening on my, just whatever little system I had there, and totally was blown away, as they say by it. Yeah, it was really a powerful experience and again it was woven into my stay in Dublin from then on, but ultimately I integrated it into the real world in my life here. Yeah, great. Were you a Radiohead fan before that? Yes, yeah, it was Radiohead. The Bends, obviously was a huge album for me as well. And I think I had seen Radiohead in concert before then, actually at First Avenue here in Minneapolis. And it was a great but simple show, simple and wasn't a big production certainly at that point. But yeah, that's where I was and that affected me greatly too, so I was already a fan into it, the Radiohead world. Yeah, yeah. Just as an aside, I grew up in St. Paul and I used to work at First Avenue. Oh really? Oh great. Back in the day. I suppose that was before your time, but... No, no. I mean, I wasn't working at First Ave then, but I was in college when it came out. Oh cool. So yeah, yeah. But yeah, another slight aside here, there is no journalistic objectivity with this. I am obsessed with this album, it means so much to me. So if you had any worries about this in any way being a hardball interview, let those worries just bake right now. But yeah, I mean, to me it is this sort of turning point, not just with their career, but with the world of music, definitely with the world of rock music. But it's this kind of bridge between the sounds of the bands and the totally insane stuff they were going to do afterwards with K&A and beyond. And I don't know that I've ever been that conscious of a band's evolution in real time, just like seeing that. And this still was a huge leap in a different direction from where the bends had been, but you can still, you know, like, electioneering songs like that that are a little more traditional rock, but are still amazing. But yeah, just like such an exciting time. And to see a band like that have such like astronomical success with an album that was such a huge change in direction, again, like so exciting. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. All that. All that you said. I mean, I agree with that. Again, I got into the bends very early on in my life anyway, and it tracked for me a little bit like some of my creative journey, like what I was doing in work and other things. And it obviously continued to affect me throughout my life and including right up to today. Honestly, maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves, but maybe K&A and all the subsequent albums, I still listen to them when I want to be inspired creatively to think about things in a different way. So the band in general kind of inspires that in me, but certainly OK Computer was a turning point of like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I when you're talking about kind of having that link to Dublin with OK Computer, I have a similar thing like Kid A came out when I was on my way to Prague, like going on the first vacation that I'd gone on on my own. And I got it in the airport and listened to it. And it was kind of like, you know, the autumn. So it's like everything's gray, just walking around Prague on my own, listening to this album over and over again. And yeah, just having that kind of for want of a less cliched phrase soundtrack to your life element to them. That I mean, you know, we're not talking about that album, but that feeling of just connection and like this really unique emotional connection. I mean, again, you know, it's all subjective, but that's that's my experience with it. Yeah, I mean, it's always been their music has always been pure emotion for me or, you know, that's what I clearly key off of and inspired by. And, you know, the bands obviously is more melodic or more digestible, I suppose. But, you know, OK Computer really clearly pushed in another direction and further down the road. And, you know, it just totally is inspirational, becomes in my mind very cinematic. Yeah, I mean, not that the bands wasn't, but no, it wasn't in the same way. It does seem really cinematic to me. I mean, the individual songs are stories in and of themselves. But to be honest, the first side or whatever you still call it that. The first side of the of the vinyl is just like a movie in itself, I think. It's pretty cool. Yeah, absolutely. And I think, if I'm not mistaken, I do know this Paranoid Android was the first single and that, again, that cinematic feeling. But it gets compared a lot to like Bohemian Rhapsody. And I can sort of see what people mean by that, like having a song that has movements and the texture of the song changes. But to my mind, like Bohemian Rhapsody is great. I'm not shitting on Bohemian Rhapsody. Let's just make that clear. But that to me is very much like the chunks of the song, the way that it changes. It's very clear. There's like a stop point. It's the delineation between the different kinds of music. Same thing with like scenes from an Italian restaurant where it's just like we're in this moment, we're in this moment. And with Paranoid Android, it's like this free flowing, like every new feeling, every new sound, it just flows from one thing into the next. It feels so natural that it took me a long time to even understand what people were talking about when they're saying like it's a song that has all of these different songs built into it. I'm like, no, it's just one big thing. But yeah, right. No, I agree. And just a testament to how they're just such fantastic musicians. Incredible. Yeah, I think the surprise of a band that had put out two albums that were solid albums, but there wasn't any indication of any kind of real weirdness. And that this was the beginning of being like more influenced by electronic music and just letting some other things in that proved to be massively influential and kind of changed the way that people thought about rock music. So like what an exciting, exciting time for music in general. Absolutely. Yeah. And relating it back to my life and career, as it influences other people and in particular me to kind of explore different places because of what they did. And on OK Computer and other things, but certainly basically on OK Computer. So, well, we're just kind of discussing how that impacted my life and my work and film. I think it has myriad influence on film, many of them we won't know until we talk to all the individual filmmakers. But for me, obviously, it is a big push and a big inspiration. So I think it's great for that. Time for a quick break because somebody's got to keep the lights on around here, but we'll be right back.

And you know there are some little cinematic ties, you know, what song I think about exit music for a film that was, you know, from Romeo and Juliet. And the directors they work with like Karma Police directed by Jonathan Glazer. I'm a big fan of his work too. Just like there's always been that relationship with the visuals, you know, the artwork on the album as well. It's a whole package. It's not just, you know, it goes beyond the music. They have a whole kind of world that they're inviting you into, which is again so so amazing. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Also, just from a, again, from a musical standpoint, the, and I think this would only become more a part of their world but the not just pushing the sounds forward not just trying to experiment with different ways of making music, but the complexity of the stuff they play. I've read things about certain songs that there's like the time signatures between the musicians kind of clash and the songs are so complex that they have to start them over again when they're playing live because they really have to concentrate to be able to like, you know, make everything fit. And you can start to hear that on this album again that it's like really, yeah, just wanting to push the bounds of what's possible with with rock and roll. Are there particular songs that stand out for you? Well, I mean, again, exit music, whatever you obviously, you know that is so melodic and so beautiful and the message of that or the what it was saying, you know, is extraordinary but I mean for me again it's the, the five or six tracks, first tracks, you know that was just all tied together for me, cinematically I just think masterpiece obviously in love all the other music on it. But I, yeah, I can't I can't say that I don't favor that first block or the move first movement of the, of the album. So, yeah, yeah, and it feels a little bit more like, you know, people say that it is a bit of a concept album I think the ideas kind of come from a lot of different places and maybe melodically it's a bit more of a concept album than, you know, the concepts themselves. Right. Right. But yeah, definitely that first half of the album feels like a cohesive whole, you know, some of the songs kind of blend into each other. It's, it all feels very seamless. Yeah, I love that part of it. Obviously I told you I was in Dublin at the time and in fact, I ended up seeing them when they came to Dublin. And that concert was just like a, you know, dream like as a lot of Radiohead concerts are, they end up being just like these dream like experiences for one thing, or for one reason or another. I mean, it's the RDS in Dublin is outside and so it was pouring rain at one point, and everybody was just kind of into the music and kind of as one swaying back and forth it was just the coolest visual to be able to look back and with the, I mean I remember fake plastic trees for some reason, as just like such a weird and mystical experience it was amazing. So, yeah, I had a very similar experience. I saw them at Madison Square Garden here and went with a bunch of friends. And I mean, that moment, fake plastic trees coming on it was, you know, very emotional for everybody but the whole time, all of us, it was like, you know, this cliche of people going to a concert that means a lot to them, everybody, arms around each other everybody tears coming down our faces the whole time and it's like every song. Absolutely, and that was, that was in Dublin too. So, universal I guess you'd say, you know that kind of experience. Yeah, and I think it's music that, to me at least, each individual song. There are there are so many of them that I can pinpoint specific moments in my life when that song was playing, or the first time that I heard it, or anything, maybe more than any other band. And again it's just a, like, a sign of their genius to me that those identifications are so clear. And I know other people who feel that way too that it's just very strong emotional pull. I agree. And I don't know for you, or for me anyway, I've traditionally been someone who kind of goes against the popular thing at the moment I mean, at least for me, I fall in love with various artists like and then it's all about them. So, early on it was Bruce Springsteen, as he started to get more popular and the whole born in the USA thing started happening I was less interested, and probably, you know gravitate toward other things but again I'm not saying I throw them out. Once they reach that point, but you know, some of the magic is gone, and maybe that has to do with you always think great artists they're talking to you, like, personally directly, and that's how I feel. And so it's at some point when people get a little too popular, you feel like, you know, so at some point, you kind of drift away I mean I feel like, as I was saying that, you know, artists are generally if I really love them or connect with them, you feel like they're speaking to you personally, and at some point when they're getting too popular and it's just obviously all, all everybody for themselves I I don't know I somewhat lose that connection, but I didn't you know obviously you don't feel that way with Radiohead because you know I guess I suppose, whatever allowances I make, because the payoff is so strong. So, you know, I think that feeling of like, and I do feel this still about people who are absolutely gigantic where it's still a little weird that it's like no this is my special private thing this is not for millions upon millions of people like I know about this and nobody else does. And with them, it's like, I have that kind of feeling, but it's still just this shock to me like when kid a was as big as it was, and it made it so they were playing arenas I'm just like, how is this happening that this is an album that I was like, oh, this is for me but nobody else is going to like this, and then it's just like the biggest thing in the world. I agree. I was living in London, when kid a came out and I remember thinking like oh maybe it'll do okay in the UK but I can't imagine that the US is going to like this and it's just like, it's fun and you know, more popular in the US and it wasn't UK so I guess the core of it for me is that, you know, radio head as a band and, you know, using okay computer as a springboard. I basically on my way to the edit, you know, in New York, all the time, you know, particularly during love and mercy and also during dream and wild the going to the edit room I constantly play, you know radio had kid a and okay computer and everything. So, you know, it's just, it always mean never ceases to inspire me to kind of push things in a different direction. Try something different, which I think is, you know, great and and what I look for in my work. I think that combination of music that just inspires you in the way that music does that it's the emotional content the lyrics, all of the, the stuff that you would expect, but then also having a career that, you know, as a band, they're taking massive risks, always pushing the boundaries of the sounds that they can make always looking for ways to do things in a totally unique way. And yeah, it's such an admirable way of creating art, something that I think, you know, any artists can even if they don't like that band aspires to that it's you want to, you want to constantly innovate you want to move forward you want to surprise people and, you know, in delightful ways ways that people really are excited about and I think they do that really well. I do too. Well works for me anyway. So yeah, yeah. All right. I appreciate this so much. This has been really, really wonderful. You know, it means a lot to me and I'm happy to be participating here. So yeah, I really appreciate that. This has been fantastic. Great. Thank you so much. I really, really appreciate this. Thank you. Take care. Love it. That was so good.
